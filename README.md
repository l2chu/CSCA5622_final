# CSCA5622 Final

For this project, my goal is to analyze various factors that impact high school students' Grade Popint Average (GPA). To do so, I will develop a supervised regression model that can estimate a student's GPA based on the most significant factors. I am very interested in learning what factors are inmportant to achieving a higher GPA. When I was studying in high school, I did not study very much, and in turn my GPA was not great. So I predict that study time will be the most impactful feature in estimating GPA. I will begin with some EDA to visualize the dataset and see the relationships between the features. Then, I will develop a model using linear regression and ADAboost to predict the GPA.


The dataset I am using is [Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset/data).
